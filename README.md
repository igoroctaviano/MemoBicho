## Comparative anatomy
Comparative anatomy is the study of similarities and differences in the anatomy of different species. It is closely related to evolutionary biology and phylogeny (the evolution of species).

## Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age. These symptoms begin by age six to twelve, are present for more than six months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting.

## Game
This game were build as a tool for a research in the comparative anatomy field of biology in an attempt to bring knowledge in a different way as well test the retention of childrens between 5 and 15 years with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

<sub>*There is a lot of improvements to be done in the application (even being that simple), it was made just as a quick tool for the research and probably soon all the code will be refactored to be more reusable.*</sub>
